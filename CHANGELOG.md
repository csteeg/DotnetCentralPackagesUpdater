## [1.4.5] - 2025-01-25

### Added

- **ðŸŽ¯ Smart Prerelease Handling**: Automatically includes prerelease versions when checking for updates if the current package version is already a prerelease
- **Visual Prerelease Indicators**: Current prerelease versions are marked with "(pre)" in the UI for easy identification
- **Enhanced Version Detection**: Uses NuGet's official version parsing to accurately detect prerelease packages

### Features

- **Automatic Behavior**: No need to use `--prerelease` flag for packages already using preview versions
- **Mixed Mode Support**: Some packages can be stable while others use prereleases, each handled appropriately
- **UI Improvements**: Clear visual indication of which packages are using prerelease versions
- **Example**: `System.CommandLine 2.0.0-beta4.22272.1 (pre)` automatically checks for newer betas and stable releases

### Technical Improvements

- **NuGet Version API**: Uses `NuGetVersion.IsPrerelease` for accurate prerelease detection
- **Fallback Detection**: Secondary pattern matching for edge cases where version parsing fails
- **Per-Package Logic**: Each package is evaluated individually for prerelease inclusion

## [1.4.4] - 2025-01-25

### Fixed

- **Migration Service**: Fixed XML processing issue where Version attributes weren't properly removed from PackageReference items during migration
- **Project File Updates**: Migration now correctly removes all Version attributes to prevent conflicts with Central Package Management

## [1.4.3] - 2025-01-25

### Added

- **ðŸš€ Migration Tool**: New `migrate` command to convert solutions from regular PackageReference to Central Package Management
- **Automated Conversion**: Scans all project files and extracts PackageReference items to create Directory.Packages.props
- **Version Consolidation**: Automatically selects the highest version when multiple projects reference different versions of the same package
- **Safe Migration**: Dry-run mode to preview changes before applying them
- **Project File Updates**: Automatically removes Version attributes from PackageReference items in project files

### Features

- **Command**: `cpup migrate --solution . --dry-run` to preview migration
- **Command**: `cpup migrate --solution .` to perform actual migration
- **Smart Analysis**: Detects both .sln files and directory-based project discovery
- **Progress Reporting**: Shows detailed progress and migration summary
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of malformed project files

### Technical Improvements

- **Target Framework**: Updated from .NET 8.0 to .NET 9.0
- **Migration Service**: New `CentralPackageMigrationService` for handling conversions
- **XML Processing**: Case-insensitive XML parsing for robust project file handling

## [1.4.2] - 2025-01-25

### Fixed

- **Framework Compatibility Protection**: Fixed issue where packages that dropped support for older frameworks (like netstandard2.0/2.1) would still be suggested for update
- Removed unsafe fallback that would suggest incompatible package versions when framework-aware checking failed
- Enhanced netstandard2.x compatibility detection to prevent breaking updates for multi-targeting projects
- Example: FluentValidation now correctly suggests v11.x (compatible) instead of v12.x (dropped netstandard2.x support)

### Technical Improvements

- Removed fallback to `GetLatestVersionAsync()` in framework-aware version checking
- Added specific logic to detect packages that dropped support for netstandard2.0/2.1
- More conservative approach when package dependency metadata is unavailable
- Improved debug logging for compatibility decisions

### Breaking Change Prevention

- Protects multi-targeting projects (`net8.0;net9.0;netstandard2.0;netstandard2.1`) from incompatible package updates
- Ensures all suggested package versions are compatible with ALL target frameworks in the project

## [1.4.1] - 2025-06-10

### Fixed

- **Case-Insensitive XML Parsing**: All XML tag names and attribute names are now parsed case-insensitively
- Resolves issues where packages with lowercase attribute names (e.g., `version="9.0.4"`) were not detected
- Improves robustness when handling Directory.Packages.props files with mixed XML casing conventions
- Supports all case variations: `PackageVersion`, `packageversion`, `PACKAGEVERSION`, etc.

### Technical Details

- Enhanced `DirectoryPackagesParser.cs` with case-insensitive XML element and attribute lookup
- Enhanced `SolutionAnalyzerService.cs` with case-insensitive XML parsing for project files
- Added comprehensive helper methods for case-insensitive XML operations
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality

## [1.4.0] - 2025-06-10

### Added

- **Directory.Build.props Support**: Automatically detects target frameworks from Directory.Build.props files
- Enhanced framework inheritance when project files don't explicitly define target frameworks
- Better analysis for complex project structures with shared properties

### Changed

- **Improved Package Version Selection**: Replaced name-based heuristics with actual package metadata analysis
- Framework-aware updates now based on real package compatibility, not naming conventions
- Uses NuGet's official compatibility APIs for more accurate framework checking

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions` and similar packages wouldn't suggest latest versions for supported frameworks
- Removed artificial version restrictions based on package naming patterns
- Fixed target framework detection when projects rely on Directory.Build.props for framework definitions

### Technical Improvements

- Removed `IsFrameworkSpecificPackage()` method that used hardcoded package name patterns
- Simplified framework compatibility logic to always use actual package metadata
- Better error handling for projects without explicit target framework definitions
